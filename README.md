This study aims to develop a forecasting tool in order to determine the significance of forest fire levels in the Hyrcanian forest, Golestan, Iran. 

MODIS MOD14A2 fire products between 2000 to 2021 has been regarded as the target of classification. Products of MOD14A2, which consists of fire-mask and quality affirmation algorithm, has the spatial and temporal resolution of 1-kilometer and 8 days and provides gridded level-3 data in the Sinusoidal projection. The data has been downloaded from "APPEEARS" platform [https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/].
